Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Human vs Computer

This program faciliates the game, as well as plays it as a Computer Player using an AI algorithm. It accomplishes the following:     

- Starts the game with a blank 4 x 4 Tic-Tac-Toe board
- Offers `X` to Human and `O` to Computer as their symbols 
- Randomly chooses who goes first -- Human or Computer
- Records the move made by each player in their own turn
- Plays Computer Player's optimal moves at their own turn
- Prints the 4 x 4 board with the symbols after every move 
- Determines after every move if any player won the game 
- Announces the result (the Winner or Draw) at the end
